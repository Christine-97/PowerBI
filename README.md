<h2>Write DAX formulas</h2>

Template to create a model calculation:

```
<Calculation name> = <DAX formula>
```

For example, the definition of the Ship Date calculated table that duplicates the Date table data is:
```
Ship Date = 'Date'
```

A DAX formula consists of expressions that return a result. The result is either a table object or a scalar value. Calculated table formulas must return a table object; calculated column and measure formulas must return a scalar value (single value).

Formulas are assembled by using:
DAX functions </li>
<li>DAX operators</li>
<li>References to model objects</li>
<li>Constant values, like the number 24 or the literal text "FY" (abbreviation for fiscal year)</li>
<li>DAX variables</li>
<li>Whitespace</li>
</ul>



```
ðŸ’¡ Tip: When you select a DAX function, it also provides you with a definition and description.Use IntelliSense to help you quickly build accurate formulas.ðŸš€

<h3>Table references</h3>

When you reference a table in a formula, officially, the table name is enclosed within single quotation marks. Single quotation marks can be omitted when both of the following conditions are true:

<ul>
<li>The table name does not include embedded spaces.</li>
<li>The table name isn't a reserved word that's used by DAX. All DAX function names and operators are reserved words. Date is a DAX function name, which explains why, when you are referencing a table named Date, that you must enclose it within single quotation marks.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Column references</h3>

When you reference a column in a formula, the column name must be enclosed within square brackets.

A table but not necessarily unique within the model, you can disambiguate the column reference by preceding it with its table name.
Disambiguated column is known as a fully qualified column. Some DAX functions require passing in fully qualified columns.


```
Revenue = SUM(Sales[Sales Amount])
```


<h3>Measure references</h3>

When you reference a measure in a formula, like column name references, the measure name must be enclosed within square brackets.

```
Same table column reference:

Profit = [Revenue] - [Cost]

______________________________________________________________________

Different table column reference:

AverageSalesPerCustomer = 
    DIVIDE(
        SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]),
        COUNTROWS(Customers)
    )

```



```

ðŸ’¡ Tip:  How to reference columns and measures within the context of data modeling or analytical work?

Here's a breakdown of the key points:

1. Measures and Tables:

Measures are mentioned as "model-level objects," indicating that they are part of the overall data model or analytical framework.
While measures are assigned to a specific home table for organizational purposes, this assignment is described as a "cosmetic relationship." In other words, it's primarily for organizational or visual purposes in tools like the Fields pane.


2. Column References with Table Names:

The statement recommends that when referencing a column, it's a good practice to precede the column reference with its table name. This is common in data modeling to avoid ambiguity when there are columns with the same name in different tables. For example: TableName.ColumnName.

3. Measures References without Table Names:

In contrast, the statement advises against preceding a measure reference with its table name. Unlike columns, measures are model-level objects, and the guidance suggests that it's unnecessary or not recommended to include the table name when referencing a measure. For example: MeasureName rather than TableName.MeasureName.



In summary, the recommendation is to maintain consistency in referencing conventions:

Prefer referencing columns with their table names for clarity and to avoid ambiguity.
Avoid including the table name when referencing measures, as they are considered model-level objects and the table reference is deemed unnecessary in this context.

<h3>DAX variables</h3>

Formulas can declare DAX variables to store results.



<h3>Whitespace</h3>

Whitespace refers to characters that you can use to format your formulas in a way that's quick and simple to understand. Whitespace characters include:

<ul>
<li>Spaces</li>
<li>Tabs</li>
<li>Carriage returns</li>
</ul>

```
ðŸ’¡ Tip: consider the following recommendations:

1. Use spaces between operators.
2. Use tabs to indent nested function calls.
3. Use carriage returns to separate function arguments, especially when it's too long to fit on a single line. Formatting in this way makes it simpler to troubleshoot, especially when the formula is missing a parenthesis. 
(In the formula bar, to enter a carriage return, press Shift+Enter. Pressing Enter alone will commit your formula.)
4. Err on the side of too much whitespace than too little.

<h4>Revenue YoY % measure</h4>


```
Revenue YoY % =
DIVIDE(
    [Revenue]
        - CALCULATE(
            [Revenue],
            SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date])
    ),
    CALCULATE(
        [Revenue],
        SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date])
    )
)
```

<b> Here's an explanation for each part:
<ul>
&#9733; [Revenue]: This is assumed to be a measure or column representing the revenue for the current period.

&#9733; CALCULATE([Revenue], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date])): This part calculates the revenue for the same period in the previous year using the SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR function. The CALCULATE function modifies the filter context, allowing you to evaluate the [Revenue] measure in a different time period.

&#9733; [Revenue] - ...: This subtracts the revenue for the previous year from the revenue for the current year.

&#9733; DIVIDE(..., ...): The DIVIDE function is used to calculate the percentage change. It takes two arguments: the numerator (the difference between current and previous revenue) and the denominator (the revenue for the previous year).
</ul>
Final Result: The formula calculates the percentage change in revenue from the previous year to the current year.</b>

#Exercise: Adding a calculated table and column

#Step 1: Download and Load Data
#Step 2: Remove all duplicate values and set the relationships between the tables.

  To eliminate all duplicate data, access the Power Query editor, right-click on the SalesOrderNumber columns, and select Remove duplicates from the drop-down menu.


#Step 3: Create a calculated table.

Access the Model view in the calculations group to create a new table. Select New table. Copy and paste the following DAX code into the formula bar:


- ADDCOLUMNS: Adds calculated columns to the given table or table expression. In this instance, the Sales table is the main table to which you need to add two more columns, one from the Date table and one from the Product table.

- Year and Color in double quotes are the names of the new columns to be added in the new calculated table.

- RELATED: Returns a related value from another table. In this case, Product color values from the Product table and Year information from the Date table.

```
Yearly Sales by color =
ADDCOLUMNS (
Sales,
"Year", RELATED ( 'Date'[Year]),
"Color", RELATED ( Products[Color]))
```
#Step 4: Create calculated columns.

To create a new column, select the Date table from the Data pane on the right side of Power BI interface. Access Model view in the Calculations group and select New column. Copy and paste the following DAX code into the formula bar:

- QUARTER: Returns each quarter as a number from the Date column.

- Date in single quotes is the table, and Date in square brackets is the column within the table.

```
Qtr = QUARTER('Date'[Date])
```

Select the Date table from the Data pane on the right side of Power BI interface. Access Model view in the Calculations group and select New column. Copy and paste the following DAX code into the formula bar:

-LEFT: Returns the specified number of characters from the start of a text string.

-Date in single quotes is the table to be referenced, and Month in square brackets is the column name. The number 3 specifies the number of characters in the short month column.

```
Month =LEFT ( 'Date'[Month], 3 )
```

To create a new column, select the Product table from the Data pane on the right side of Power BI interface. Access Model view in the calculations group. Then select New column to expand the formula bar. Copy and paste the following DAX code into the formula bar:

- RELATED here is the same as referencing a column from another table.

```
Product Color = RELATED ( Products[Color] )
```
